TASK DESCRIPTION

The goal of this project was to design and develop a personal portfolio website using only HTML and CSS. The website acts as a digital introduction, allowing visitors to learn about the individual, view skills, explore projects, and find contact information. This project was created as part of a learning and practice task to strengthen basic front-end development skills and to build a professional online presence.

The structure of the website was created using HTML5. Semantic elements were used to organize content clearly and meaningfully. The portfolio includes common sections such as Home, About, Skills, Projects, and Contact. Each section is placed logically to ensure smooth navigation and a better user experience. The HTML code is clean and well-structured, making the website easy to read, understand, and maintain.

CSS was used to style and design the website. It was responsible for the layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and overall visual appearance. A modern color theme with gradient backgrounds was applied to make the website attractive and engaging. CSS Flexbox was used to align elements properly, especially in the navigation bar and hero section. Buttons, headings, and images were styled with rounded corners and hover effects to improve the visual quality.

The homepage features a hero section with a short introduction, a professional role description, and a call-to-action button. This section is designed to create a strong first impression for visitors. The navigation bar at the top allows users to move easily between different sections of the website. It is simple, clear, and user-friendly.

This project focuses completely on static frontend development. No JavaScript or backend technologies were used. By working only with HTML and CSS, the project emphasizes strong fundamentals such as layout design, responsive structure, and clean styling. The website is responsive and adjusts well to different screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

It also helped improve confidence, creativity, and attention to detail while practicing real world web design standards and preparing for future learning opportunities and professional growth in frontend development.
